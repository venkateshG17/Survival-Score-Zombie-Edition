            <p>
                The Zombie Apocalypse Survival Test is designed to assess your chances of surviving in a world overrun by zombies. 
                It evaluates your readiness across several important categories, including:
            </p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: none; padding-left: 0;">
                <li><strong>Scenario-Based Questions:</strong> Test how you handle critical situations and make decisions in high-pressure survival scenarios.</li>
                <li><strong>Physical Tasks:</strong> Gauge your physical abilities, such as running, stamina, and handling different survival skills.</li>
                <li><strong>Medical Health:</strong> Assess your current medical condition and how it might impact your ability to survive.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This test is based on your personal opinions and decisions — there are no correct or wrong answers. 
                It simply gives you an idea of how well-prepared you might be for a zombie apocalypse, based on your responses.
            </p>
            <p>
                Remember, survival is not just about physical strength but also about quick thinking, problem-solving, and adapting to the situation at hand. Good luck!
            </p>
            
                <h2 class="m-5">Choose Your Role</h2>
                <p>Before taking the test, you can select a role that best fits your personality and skills. Each role offers a different approach to surviving the zombie apocalypse:</p>
                
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-md-6 mb-4">
                        <h4>Gym Guy</h4>
                        <p>The Gym Guy is all about fitness. He’s strong, has high endurance, and is ready to take on zombies physically. If you're into fitness and believe your strength and stamina will help you survive, this is your role.</p>
                    </div>
            
                    <div class="col-md-6 mb-4">
                        <h4>Athletic Guy</h4>

                    </div>
            
                    <div class="col-md-6 mb-4">
                        <h4>Nerd Guy</h4>
